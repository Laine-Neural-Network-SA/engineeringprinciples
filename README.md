# Laine Engineering Principles

Welcome! This document outlines the core principles that guide our engineering culture, decisions, and processes at Laine.

---

### We optimize for people, not technology

The biggest limitation on the success of a company is the productivity and engagement of its people. Whenever we make a decision, we will **always, within reason, prioritize making our people more engaged and productive.**

---

### Sustainability over intensity

We don’t want to get into a foot race between our burn rate and a burnout. We care about keeping our development intensity at a sustainable pace.

Sustainability is not a straight line, however. Our development intensity mirrors a **periodization approach** similar to what is found in sports science, with higher intensity, peak, and recovery blocks.

### Collaboration in a remote-friendly environment

Laine is a remote-first company. With engineers living largely distributed, we value collaboration very highly.

* With complex tasks, two engineers will work closely to build it together.
* With shorter tasks (<1 day), we either deliver before the end of the day or add an engineer.
* **We ask for help early and prioritize helping others over our own work.**

### Match complexity with business value

We have a strong reluctance to accept complexity. 
We focus on accepting complexity where there is a strong impact on moving our business forward. 

---

### We keep systems loosely coupled and independently deployable
Dependencies add complexity. We rely heavily on the inversion of control principle and reduce dependencies wherever possible. 

---

### Engineers own business outcomes, not technologies
Engineers always look at the shortest, most maintainable, path to business value and work backwards towards technology. 

---

### Shrink the use case, don’t expand the technology
If an existing technology covers 90% of the use case, we shrink the scope, rather than add technology. 

---

### Adopt new tools with an old mind
The development and AI ecosystems continue to change and evolve quickly. However, with change comes risk. We balance adopting new tools by evaluating them with a strong level of skepticism. Tools need to deliver 2-3x improvement to the as-is situation at least. 50% extra is not enough.
